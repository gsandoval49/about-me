			<main>
				<p>I grew up in San Felipe Pueblo, NM in a big family. I'm the oldest of many brothers, sisters, and close cousins. I went to high school, college, and have had many fun jobs prior to this class. I've been a chef, a paramedic, a store manager, a director of a team, a mentor, and a coach. I've had other important jobs, such as working as a janitor, busser, and dishwasher. :D Those jobs taught me the importance of hard work. Here's where I'm at now...</p>
